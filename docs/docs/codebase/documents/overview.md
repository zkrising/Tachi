# Documents

Tachi's database has specific documents for specific
things. This part of the documentation covers the
shape of those documents.

!!! note
	Quite often, the API exposes these documents as-is,
	without running a projection step on the fields.
	
	This means that the API documentation will
	involve frequent links to this part of the
	codebase documentation.

!!! help
	This section is a bit sparse, as I don't have the
	time to populate it all. If you want to contribute
	to this, please see [Contributing](../contributing.md).

## Definition

This part of the documentation will define the shape of the
document, and explain fields where necessary.

Depending on whats easiest, this may just be a raw
TypeScript interface definition, or it may be a table.

## Example

This part of the documentation will show an example document,
with some explainations if necessary.
