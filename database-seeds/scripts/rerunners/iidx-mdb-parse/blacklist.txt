# songID + playtype + difficulty combos to ignore
# these are regexes, and parse things in the format of
# C$songid-$playtype-$difficulty
# they also receive strings in the format of
# S$songid
# this is to support features like ignoring entire songs, with something like
# S1234$
# lines starting with '#' are ignored

# we don't care about beginners
