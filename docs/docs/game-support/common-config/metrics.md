# Metrics

Metrics are what kind of values we want to track on this GPT's scores. Common things for this are values like `score`, `lamp`, maybe even `grade`.

A metric definition looks like this:

```ts
{
	type: "INTEGER",
	validate: p.isBetween(0, 100_000),
	formatter: FmtNum,
	description: "The score value.",
}
```

## Metric Types

We're allowed 5 types of metrics:

- `DECIMAL`

This metric is expected to be a decimal.

!!! example
	```ts
	percent: {
		type: "DECIMAL",
		validate: p.isBetween(0, 100),
		formatter: FmtPercent,
		description: "EX Score divided by the maximum possible EX Score on this chart.",
	},
	```

- `INTEGER`

This metric is expected to be a whole number.

!!! example
	```ts
	{
		type: "INTEGER",
		validate: p.isBetween(0, 100_000),
		formatter: FmtNum,
		description: "The score value.",
	}
	```

- `ENUM`

This metric is expected to be a string in a provided ordered list of strings. This is used to implement things like `"FAILED", "CLEAR", "FULL COMBO", "PERFECT"` lamps.

!!! example
	```ts
	{
		type: "ENUM",
		values: [
			"NO PLAY",
			"FAILED",
			"ASSIST CLEAR",
			"EASY CLEAR",
			"CLEAR",
			"HARD CLEAR",
			"EX HARD CLEAR",
			"FULL COMBO",
		],
		minimumRelevantValue: "EASY CLEAR",
		description: "The type of clear this was.",
	},
	```


- `GRAPH`

This metric is an array of numbers.

- `NULLABLE_GRAPH`

This metric is an array of numbers or null.

!!! example
	```ts
		gaugeHistory: {
			type: "NULLABLE_GRAPH",
			validate: p.isBetween(0, 100),
			description:
				"A snapshot of the gauge percent throughout the chart. The values should be null from the point the user dies until the end of the chart.",
		},
	```

	Importantly: something like `[99, 74, 12, null, null, null]` would be legal as a nullable graph.

	This does not mean the field itself is nullable, only the values inside the array!

## Enum Metrics

Metrics of type `ENUM` are special in many ways. Most importantly, they don't require
any sort of validation - the input is either a member of `values` or it isn't.

An ENUM metric looks like this:
```ts
{
	type: "ENUM",
	values: [
		"NO PLAY",
		"FAILED",
		"ASSIST CLEAR",
		"EASY CLEAR",
		"CLEAR",
		"HARD CLEAR",
		"EX HARD CLEAR",
		"FULL COMBO",
	],
	minimumRelevantValue: "EASY CLEAR",
	description: "The type of clear this was.",
},
```

The order of `values` is extremely important: the first value should be the worst possible value in the metric, and the last value should be the best possible value.

`minimumRelevantValue` indicates the smallest value in this enum that a user will
ever realistically care about getting. This is used in the UI and other places to
hide useless ENUM values from the user.

!!! example
	![](../../images/min-relevant-value.png)

	Despite the fact this user failed a bunch of stuff this session, the UI won't
	show me my new `FAILED` or `ASSIST CLEAR` scores!

## Integer and Decimal Metrics

These kinds of metrics, given their more open-ended nature, require some validation.

### Validation

There are two kinds of metric validations. If a metric can be validated, it should have
a property called `validate` which returns true on success, and a string representing
an error message on failure:

!!! example
	```ts
	{
			type: "INTEGER",
			validate: (value) => {
				if (value > 100_000) { return "Score cannot be greater than 100k." }

				return true;
			},
			formatter: FmtNum,
			description: "The score value.",
	}
	```

!!! note
	The type of input is already checked for you. You don't need to check whether your
	input is an integer or not if you declare `type: "INTEGER"`. The same goes for
	`type: "GRAPH"`, the validator instead runs on each element in the array.

!!! tip
	The reason for this rather strange type signature (`string | true`) is because we
	can use our validation library - [Prudence](https://github.com/zkrising/Prudence) - to create validators for us. Instead
	of writing out that validation code, we can use `p.isBetween(0, 100_000)`!

However, it might not be possible to validate a metric without knowing what chart
the score is on. For example, in IIDX the maximum amount of score you can get is
the chart's notecount * 2.

Since we don't know what this GPT chart's look like at this time (we haven't defined them yet!)
we instead don't declare a validator and put down `chartDependentMax: true` instead.

We will have to write the validator later in the server implementation.

### Formatting

We also want to format these metrics into a string. For example, a `percent` metric may want to stringify into `92.45%` instead of `92.49938222293842`.
More subtle formatting rules can be defined here too, such as how in Jubeat, scores are
easier to read written like `903,283` instead of `903283`.

## Graph Metrics

Graph metrics (`GRAPH` and `NULLABLE_GRAPH`) also have to define a validator, but the validator is called on each element of their respective arrays.

To validate that all of the values in a graph metric are between 0 and 10, you could
write a validator like:
```ts
function validate(value: number) {
	if (value < 0) return "too small";
	if (value > 10) return "too big";
	return true;
}
```

This is remarkably similar to how validators work for `INTEGER` and `DECIMAL` metrics.

Furthermore, graph metrics can specify a `size` function, which validates the size of
the array too. You can use this to enforce a certain array size (such as exactly 100 entries, or similar).

## Now what?

This is how metrics work, but there's more detail in how they're defined in each game's config.

For example, some metrics (like `grade` for a lot of games) are merely functions of other metrics. Making every import method handle this themselves seems silly. How do we tackle this? This, and more, is answered in [Metric Groups](./metric-groups.md)!
