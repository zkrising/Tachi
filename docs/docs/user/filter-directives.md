# What Are Filter Directives?

Filter Directives are a fancy way of *filtering* rows inside a table.

They provide an advanced toolkit for users to whittle down what they
actually want to see!

!!! tip
	You can tell if a field supports filter directives if it has a lightning
	bolt next to it. You can mouse over and click on the lightning bolt for
	more information about what filter directives are available!

## Simple Example

In the below examples, let's assume we're talking about a table of a users
scores.

By default, the filter bar loosely searches every column in the table. So if
you search for `AA`, You will get a list of all the scores that were on a song
that contains `AA` (such as `AA -rebuild-`) and all of the scores that have the grade
`AA` (OR `AAA`, as it's a loose match!).

This isn't always what we want, though! What if I wanted to see only scores
on the song `AA`?

That's where Filter Directives come in. We can search for that using:

```
title:AA
```

Simple enough, right!

Now, depending on *where* you actually are, different filter directives are
available. The above example makes sense for filtering scores, but makes *no*
sense for filtering a table of users!

!!! tip
	You can *always* find out what directives are available by clicking the
	lightning bolt next to the field.

## Advanced Example

Before, we mentioned that this was a *powerful* toolkit for filtering rows
in a table. The above example is fairly mundane, though. What else can we do?

By default, a directive performs a loose match on that value, but we can
change that behaviour!

| Name | Example | What it does. |
| :: | :: | :: |
| Normal | `title:AA` | Matches any title that contains "AA". |
| Exact | `title:!AA` | Matches any title that is *exactly* AA. |
| Less Than | `percent:<50` | Matches any percent that is less than 50. |
| Less Than Equal | `percent:<=50` | Matches any percent that is less than or equal to 50. |
| Greater Than | `percent:>50` | Matches any percent that is greater than 50. |
| Greater Than Equal | `percent:>=50` | Matches any percent that is greater than or equal to 50. |
| Regex | `title:~^[a-z]*$` | Matches any title that matches the regex `^[a-z]*$` |

!!! note
	Regex Mode refers to [Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

	If you aren't familiar, don't worry! This specific mode is barely useful
	and for nerds.

## Other Things

You can use multiple directives in one filter!

`title:!AA percent:>50` - Find all scores on AA where the percent is greater than 50.

Multiple directives are separated by spaces. However, if you need to use a
space inside a value, you should quote it, like this:

`title:!"FREEDOM DiVE" percent:>50`.

!!! tip
	If you need quotes *inside* that, you should escape them, like this:

	`artist:!"A Tribe Called \"Quest\"" percent:>50`

	However, it is likely you will never need to use this.
