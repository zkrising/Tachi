# Import Scores

*****

## Import scores from a file.

```POST /api/v1/import/file```

Perform a score import that depends on a file, such as a .csv import.

### Permissions

- `submit_score`

### Parameters

This endpoint expects data in `multipart/form-data` form.
This is because we're handling file imports, and is the
appropriate way to send files.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `importType` | String | The ImportType this import is for. This only accepts `file/` [ImportTypes](../../tachi-server/import/import-types.md). |
| `scoreData` | File | The file to import scores from. |

| HTTP Header | Description |
| :: | :: |
| `X-User-Intent` (optional) | If this header is present, the request is assumed to have been sent with 'User Intent'. For more on this, see [Import Types](../../tachi-server/import/import-types.md) |

!!! info
	It's the responsibility of the API user to use the X-User-Intent
	header properly. It should only be used when the user
	has explicitly requested this import (i.e. not sent by an automated script).

### Response

**Implementation Dependent**.
There are two reponse scenarios for this endpoint, depending on whether the server uses an external score processor or not.

#### External Score Processor Response

If an external score processor is being used, **202** is returned as a status code, and you are given the following:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `url` | String | A URL to poll for information about this import, while it's being processed. |
| `importID` | String | The ID of the import currently being processed. |

#### Internal Score Processor Response

If score processing is not done externally, the following is returned:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `<body>` | ImportDocument | The import document created as a result of this import. |

### Example

#### Request
```
POST /api/v1/import/file
