			<div>
				<ExternalLink href="https://github.com/XezolesS/WaccaMyPageScraper/">
					WaccaMyPageScraper
				</ExternalLink>{" "}
				is a scraper for the official WACCA MyPage service site. Since the site is offline
				as of September 1, 2022, this is only useful if you have used the scraper before
				then.
			</div>
			<h1 className="text-center my-4">What can I import?</h1>
			<div>
				Based on the data saved from the scraper, your <b>PBs</b> and{" "}
				<b>maximum Stage Up rank</b> can be imported. WaccaMyPageScraper doesn't record any
				recent plays, so if you have played a chart multiple times, only the PB will be
				imported.
			</div>
			<h1 className="text-center my-4">How does it work?</h1>
			<div>
				Within the WaccaMyPageScraper directory there is a "data" directory, which contains
				two files we care about:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>records/records.csv</b> contains all your personal bests.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>player/player.csv</b> contains your player info, including your Stage Up
						rank.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Both of these can be imported below in the corresponding sections.
