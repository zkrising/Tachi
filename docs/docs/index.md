# Tachi Documentation

This site serves as the documentation for Tachi.

Tachi is a rhythm game score tracking engine, and is the name of the codebase that powers
both [Bokutachi](https://bokutachi.xyz) and [Kamaitachi](https://kamaitachi.xyz).

## About This Documentation

So that we don't have to write and maintain three separate sets of documentation, this site
works like a Monorepo for Tachi's documentation.

*****

### API Reference

This is for people who want to make things with Tachi's API, and assumes basic knowledge of
APIs and how they work.

View it [here](./api/overview.md).

### Server Codebase Reference

This is for people who want to work on `Tachi-Server`'s codebase.
This contains things like the tools we use and the
infrastructure that powers Tachi.

View it [here](./tachi-server/overview.md).

### Bot Codebase Reference

This is for people who want to work on the `Tachi-Bot`.
This codebase is maintained by [pfych](https://github.com/pfych), and is wrote in TypeScript.

View it [here](./tachi-bot/overview.md).

### User Reference

This is for end user reference, such as score importing tutorials, documentation on tachi's
statistics. It requires no programming knowledge, and is mostly used as a wiki-like reference.

View it [here](./user/overview.md).
